# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repository is maintained on a best-effort basis.

If you are running this in production, prefer pinned releases/tarballs and test changes in a staging environment first.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue:

1. **Do not** open a public issue with exploit details.
2. Contact the maintainer via GitHub (open a minimal issue saying "security report" without details, or use a private channel if available).
3. Include:
   - affected script/monitor name
   - environment/distro
   - steps to reproduce
   - expected vs actual behavior

We will respond as soon as practical.
