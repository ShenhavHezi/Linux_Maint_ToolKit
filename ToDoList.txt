# Linux_Maint_ToolKit — Roadmap & Backlog (2026-02-24)

## Project brief
Linux_Maint_ToolKit is a lightweight, offline‑friendly Linux maintenance and health toolkit.
It runs locally or via SSH, emits machine‑parseable summary lines, and keeps outputs stable for automation.
Primary audiences: operators, sysadmins, and SREs working in constrained or air‑gapped environments.

## Principles
- Bash‑only runtime; no new runtime dependencies.
- Machine outputs are clean and parse‑safe (stdout contract preserved).
- Minimal, reversible changes; strong tests + docs for any behavior change.

## Priority legend
- P0: correctness / safety
- P1: operator UX / docs / compatibility
- P2: security / hardening / performance
- P3: observability / integrations / QA
- P4: DX / release polish / community

---

## P0 — Correctness / safety (next)
- Audit every monitor for strict summary contract: one `monitor=` line per host path, no duplicates, consistent `reason` values.
- Make smoke/compat tests fully deterministic: no dependency on missing system tools, no shared lock dirs, no timing flakes.
- Enforce JSON cleanliness: guarantee progress/spinner output never appears when any `--json` mode is active.
- Harden host parsing in `lm_hosts` (comments, whitespace, IPv6, user@host, host:port) with tests.
- Validate config file parsing for all monitors (missing file behavior must be SKIP/UNKNOWN with explicit reason).
- Ensure `linux-maint run` exit codes align with summary status severity and documented semantics.
- Add atomic writes for run index and summary files (temp + rename), with crash‑safe behavior.

---

## P1 — Operator UX / docs / compatibility (next)
- Add a single “Quickstart for air‑gapped systems” in `README.md` with copy‑paste commands.
- Create a per‑monitor config reference table (file path, required/optional, example lines).
- Document `reason` codes and suggested operator actions in one consolidated cheat sheet.
- Add “Common failures & fixes” section for SSH, missing dependencies, and config errors.
- Expand `linux-maint help` examples for `report`, `trend`, `diff`, and `run` (including color/no‑color flags).
- Document supported distros and minimum versions (bash/coreutils/openssl), plus known limitations.
- Add a compatibility preflight check that warns on unsupported bash versions or missing core tools.

---

## P2 — Security / hardening / performance (soon)
- Add optional strict known_hosts workflows: detect changes, explain remediation, and allow hash output.
- Extend log redaction patterns and add tests (tokens, bearer, auth headers, SSH keys).
- Add a `--redact` flag for report/trend outputs (human output only, never touch JSON).
- Add minimal‑privilege guidance for sudoers entries and SSH keys in `SECURITY.md`.
- Provide integrity checks for release artifacts (checksums + verification instructions).
- Add adaptive concurrency (`LM_MAX_PARALLEL`) with safe defaults and guardrails for large fleets.
- Add lightweight caching for expensive inventory/trend computations (opt‑in, time‑boxed).

---

## P3 — Observability / integrations / QA (later)
- Expand metrics output: per‑monitor duration, count of hosts, and summary severity counts.
- Add `trend --export` CSV/JSON modes with stable schema and date range filters.
- Provide Prometheus textfile examples and a sample systemd timer for scraping.
- Add run index retention tooling (cleanup command + docs + tests).
- Add CI matrix coverage for bash 4.2/4.4 and minimal‑dependency containers.
- Add fixture‑driven tests per monitor for predictable edge‑case coverage.

---

## P4 — DX / release polish / community (later)
- Introduce a release helper that bumps `VERSION`, updates notes, and validates required files.
- Add a lightweight CI “fast lane” (lint + unit tests only) for quick pre‑commit checks.
- Standardize packaging outputs (RPM metadata, install paths, config examples) and document them.
- Create a minimal “dev quickstart” for contributors (tests to run, CI expectations, style rules).
- Add GitHub issue/PR templates and a support policy section in `README.md`.
