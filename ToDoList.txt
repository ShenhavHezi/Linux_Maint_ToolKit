# Linux_Maint_ToolKit - Roadmap and Backlog (2026-02-24)

## Project brief
Linux_Maint_ToolKit is a lightweight, offline-friendly Linux maintenance and health toolkit.
It runs locally or via SSH, emits machine-parseable summary lines, and keeps outputs stable for automation.
Primary audiences: operators, sysadmins, and SREs working in constrained or air-gapped environments.

## Principles
- Bash-only runtime, no new runtime dependencies.
- Machine outputs are clean and parse-safe, stdout contract preserved.
- Minimal, reversible changes, tests and docs required for behavior changes.

## Success criteria
- One command gets a useful status report with sane defaults.
- Summary contract is stable and validated across all monitors and CLI outputs.
- Works on RHEL 9 and common distros with clear compatibility guidance.
- CI is reliable with low flake and deterministic tests.

## Priority legend
- P0: correctness and safety
- P1: operator UX, docs, compatibility
- P2: security, hardening, performance
- P3: observability, integrations, QA
- P4: DX, release polish, community

---

## P0 - Correctness and safety (next)
- Audit every monitor for strict summary contract: one monitor line per host path, no duplicates, consistent reason values.
- Enforce reason presence for non-OK statuses and add a lint that fails on missing reason.
- Make smoke and compat tests deterministic: no dependency on missing system tools, no shared lock dirs, no timing flakes.
- Enforce JSON cleanliness: never emit progress or color on any --json output.
- Harden host parsing in lm_hosts: comments, whitespace, IPv6, user@host, host:port, dedupe, and tests.
- Validate config parsing across all monitors: missing file must be SKIP or UNKNOWN with explicit reason.
- Ensure linux-maint run exit codes align with summary severity and documented semantics.
- Make run index and summary writes atomic with temp + rename, crash safe.
- Guard against locale and timezone drift in tests and outputs by pinning LC_ALL and TZ where needed.

---

## P1 - Operator UX, docs, compatibility (next)
- Add a single Quickstart for air-gapped systems in README with copy-paste steps.
- Create a per-monitor config reference table: file path, required or optional, example lines.
- Consolidate reason codes and suggested actions into a single cheat sheet.
- Add Common failures and fixes for SSH, missing deps, and config errors.
- Expand linux-maint help examples for report, trend, diff, run with color and no-color examples.
- Document supported distros and minimum versions for bash, coreutils, openssl.
- Add a compatibility preflight check that warns on unsupported bash or missing core tools.
- Document repo mode vs installed mode behavior differences and recommended use cases.

---

## P2 - Security, hardening, performance (soon)
- Provide strict known_hosts workflows: detect host key changes, explain remediation, allow hash output.
- Extend log redaction patterns with tests for tokens, bearer, auth headers, SSH keys.
- Add a --redact flag for human outputs only, JSON untouched.
- Add minimal-privilege guidance for sudoers and SSH keys in SECURITY.
- Provide release artifact integrity checks with checksums and verification steps.
- Add adaptive concurrency with safe defaults and guardrails for large fleets.
- Add lightweight caching for inventory and trend computations, opt-in and time-boxed.
- Add per-monitor timeouts for remote commands where missing, with tests.

---

## P3 - Observability, integrations, QA (later)
- Expand metrics output: per-monitor duration, host counts, severity totals.
- Add trend export modes for CSV and JSON with stable schema and date range filters.
- Provide Prometheus textfile examples and a sample systemd timer for scraping.
- Add run index retention tooling with docs and tests.
- Add CI matrix coverage for bash 4.2 and 4.4 plus minimal dependency containers.
- Add fixture-driven tests per monitor for edge cases and regression coverage.
- Add schema validation tests for all JSON outputs across commands.

---

## P4 - DX, release polish, community (later)
- Introduce a release helper that bumps VERSION, updates notes, and validates required files.
- Add a CI fast lane for lint and unit tests to speed local iteration.
- Standardize packaging outputs and document install paths and config examples.
- Add DEB packaging or a clear statement of why RPM-only is intentional.
- Create a minimal dev quickstart for contributors: tests to run, CI expectations, style rules.
- Add GitHub issue and PR templates and a support policy section in README.
