# Linux_Maint_ToolKit — Roadmap & Backlog (2026-02-24)

## Project brief
Linux_Maint_ToolKit is a lightweight, offline‑friendly Linux maintenance and health toolkit.
It runs locally or via SSH, emits machine‑parseable summary lines, and keeps outputs stable for automation.
Primary audiences: operators, sysadmins, and SREs working in constrained or air‑gapped environments.

## Principles
- Bash‑only runtime; no new runtime dependencies.
- Machine outputs are clean and parse‑safe (stdout contract preserved).
- Minimal, reversible changes; strong tests + docs for any behavior change.

## Priority legend
- P0: correctness / safety
- P1: operator UX / docs
- P2: security / hardening
- P3: observability / integrations
- P4: DX / release polish

---

## P0 — Correctness / safety (next)

1. Core command contract checklist
   Outcome: doc/checklist covering `status/report/summary/diff` output guarantees.
   Acceptance: contract doc linked from docs index; changes require checklist review.

---

## P1 — Operator UX / docs (next)

1. Group-by output limits
   Outcome: optional `--top N` for `status --group-by` to cap rows for large fleets.
   Acceptance: stable ordering; tests cover default and capped output.

2. Quickstart install doc polish
   Outcome: tighten `docs/OPERATIONS.md` with a 10-minute installed-mode walkthrough.
   Acceptance: operator path validated, no duplicate content in README.

3. Upgrade / rollback guidance
   Outcome: short, safe upgrade and rollback steps for installed mode.
   Acceptance: doc referenced from README and OPERATIONS.

4. Reasons quick-reference
   Outcome: top-10 reasons quick list with links to `docs/REASONS.md`.
   Acceptance: added to docs index and operator docs.

---

## P2 — Security / hardening (soon)

1. Known_hosts seeding helper
   Outcome: helper script to pre-populate `LM_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` for strict mode.
   Acceptance: offline-safe and documented; no runtime deps added.

2. SSH allowlist defaults (docs)
   Outcome: add recommended `LM_SSH_ALLOWLIST` examples and guidance.
   Acceptance: documented in config reference; include example config snippet.

---

## P3 — Observability / integrations (later)

1. Run index JSON schema
   Outcome: schema for `run_index.jsonl` entries and history JSON contract.
   Acceptance: schema + tests; contract version documented.

2. Prometheus contract note
   Outcome: document label stability and metric meanings for Prometheus output.
   Acceptance: referenced in `docs/reference.md` and `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`.

---

## P4 — DX / release polish (later)

1. Docs link check in CI
   Outcome: CI job validates internal doc links (README + docs index).
   Acceptance: job fails on broken links; offline-safe.

2. Release prep helper
   Outcome: script to bump version + draft CHANGELOG section for release notes.
   Acceptance: `make release-prep` (or similar) updates VERSION/CHANGELOG consistently.
