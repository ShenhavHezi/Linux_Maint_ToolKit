# linux-maint — ToDoList (fresh roadmap)

This is the single backlog source of truth.

## Working style
- Pick **one** item per PR.
- Keep changes small, reversible, and test-backed.
- Prefer improving existing behavior over adding new monitors.
- Dark-site/offline reliability is the primary product focus.

## Priority legend
- **P0**: correctness/contract/runtime reliability
- **P1**: dark-site operator experience
- **P2**: security and hardening
- **P3**: signal quality and observability
- **P4**: DX/release polish

## Tags
- `[dark-site]` offline/air-gapped operator flow
- `[contract]` summary/output guarantees and test robustness
- `[ops]` runbook/doctor/operator experience
- `[security]` hardening and data handling
- `[dx]` contributor and release workflow

## P0 — Correctness / contract / runtime reliability

### P0.0 [ops][dx] Resolve ToDoList/summarize merge-conflict workflow (DONE 2026-02-15)
**Why**: requiring frequent updates to both planning/history docs caused recurring PR merge conflicts.

**Where**:
- `.github/workflows/docs_consistency.yml`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `summarize.txt`

**Acceptance**:
- Code-change policy requires `ToDoList.txt` updates as the single planning source.
- `summarize.txt` is documented as less-frequent capability snapshot (not per-fix changelog).

**Verify**:
- CI meta-doc check references `ToDoList.txt` only.

---

### P0.1 [dark-site][ops] Doctor gate parity with wrapper (DONE 2026-02-15)
**Why**: wrapper now SKIPs `network_monitor` when `network_targets.txt` is missing, but `linux-maint doctor` skip-gate hints do not show that gate yet.

**Where**:
- `bin/linux-maint`

**Acceptance**:
- `doctor` prints a `network_monitor` skip-gate hint when `$CFG_DIR/network_targets.txt` is missing/empty.
- Keep current output format style and no breaking changes.

**Verify**:
- Add/extend a test to assert the new doctor hint.
- ✅ Implemented: doctor now reports network_targets gate to match wrapper SKIP behavior.

---

### P0.2 [contract] Contract test monitor timeout guard (DONE 2026-02-15)
**Why**: if one monitor hangs in CI, `tests/summary_contract.sh` can stall too long and hide root cause.

**Where**:
- `tests/summary_contract.sh`

**Acceptance**:
- Wrap each monitor invocation with a bounded timeout.
- On timeout, fail with clear monitor name and include captured output tail.

**Verify**:
- Add a fixture monitor or controlled path proving timeout handling works.
- ✅ Implemented: per-monitor timeout guard added to `tests/summary_contract.sh` plus `tests/summary_contract_timeout_guard_test.sh`.

---

### P0.3 [contract] Preflight summary-line noise reduction (NOT DONE)
**Why**: preflight currently emits multiple summary lines from optional dependency checks, making contract output noisy.

**Where**:
- `monitors/preflight_check.sh`
- `lib/linux_maint.sh` (only if needed)

**Acceptance**:
- Keep one actionable summary line per host in normal paths.
- Move extra details to log output, not summary contract lines.

**Verify**:
- Extend `tests/summary_contract.sh` / preflight-focused test coverage.

---

## P1 — Dark-site / offline operator experience (main focus)

### P1.1 [dark-site] Add `LM_DARK_SITE=true` profile toggle (NOT DONE)
**Why**: air-gapped operators need one simple switch with conservative defaults.

**Where**:
- `run_full_health_monitor.sh`
- `etc/linux_maint/linux-maint.conf.example`
- `docs/DARK_SITE.md`

**Acceptance**:
- Profile is optional and fully backward-compatible when unset.
- Document exactly which defaults change (minimal, predictable set).

**Verify**:
- Add tests for profile on/off behavior.

---

### P1.2 [dark-site][ops] Dark-site “day-0 bootstrap” checklist (NOT DONE)
**Why**: first-run friction is still higher than needed for base users.

**Where**:
- `docs/DARK_SITE.md`
- `README.md`

**Acceptance**:
- Add a short “minimum files for first successful run” section.
- Include expected SKIP statuses so operators know what is normal.

**Verify**:
- Walk through docs end-to-end in a clean VM/container.

---

### P1.3 Offline dependency manifest helper (NOT DONE)
**Why**: offline teams need a quick way to know optional tools that improve coverage.

**Where**:
- `bin/linux-maint` (new subcommand or doctor extension)
- `docs/reference.md`

**Acceptance**:
- Print required vs optional command matrix by monitor.
- No network calls; pure local report.

**Verify**:
- Add test that validates stable key output lines.

---

## P2 — Security / hardening

### P2.1 [security] Pack-logs redaction review + tests (NOT DONE)
**Why**: support bundles are critical in dark-site incident handoff; redaction needs explicit test coverage for sensitive patterns.

**Where**:
- `tools/pack_logs.sh`
- `tests/pack_logs_test.sh`

**Acceptance**:
- Add redaction cases for common secret-like keys/tokens in config snapshots.
- Preserve troubleshooting usefulness while removing sensitive values.

**Verify**:
- Tests assert sensitive strings are absent and placeholders are present.

---

### P2.2 SSH option policy docs + guardrails (NOT DONE)
**Why**: fleet mode relies on `LM_SSH_OPTS`; policy clarity reduces accidental insecure overrides.

**Where**:
- `bin/linux-maint`
- `docs/reference.md`

**Acceptance**:
- Keep current validation strict, document accepted patterns and examples.
- Add test cases for safe/unsafe option strings.

**Verify**:
- Extend SSH-option validation tests.

---

## P3 — Signal quality / observability

### P3.1 Status filter matching modes (NOT DONE)
**Why**: current `--host/--monitor` use substring matching only; exact/regex mode helps automation.

**Where**:
- `bin/linux-maint`
- `tests/status_filters_test.sh`
- `docs/reference.md`

**Acceptance**:
- Add explicit exact and/or regex modes while preserving current behavior.
- Keep compact and JSON output behavior aligned.

**Verify**:
- Positive and negative filter tests for each mode.

---

### P3.2 Disk trend inode summary rollup (NOT DONE)
**Why**: inode trend data exists but does not surface concise summary signal.

**Where**:
- `monitors/disk_trend_monitor.sh`
- `tests/disk_trend_inode_trend_test.sh`

**Acceptance**:
- When inode trend enabled, emit compact inode rollup keys in summary.
- Keep summary length bounded and parse-safe.

**Verify**:
- Extend inode trend test assertions.

---

## P4 — DX / release polish

### P4.1 [dx] Add `make install-githooks` (NOT DONE)
**Why**: lower contributor friction and standardize local checks.

**Where**:
- `Makefile`

**Acceptance**:
- Add make target and include it in `make help`.
- Idempotent behavior.

**Verify**:
- Run target twice; second run remains clean.

---

### P4.2 Remove `summarize.txt` from active workflow (decision item) (NOT DONE)
**Why**: maintaining two planning/history files (`ToDoList.txt` + `summarize.txt`) increases overhead.

**Where**:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- CI/documentation policy (where applicable)

**Acceptance**:
- Decide single source of truth for planning/history.
- If deprecated, state migration path and update contributor guidance.

**Verify**:
- CI/docs checks pass with the new policy.
