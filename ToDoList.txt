# Linux_Maint_ToolKit - Roadmap and Backlog (2026-02-25)

## Project brief
Linux_Maint_ToolKit is a lightweight, offline-first Linux health toolkit for fleet and single-host checks.
It runs locally or over SSH, emits stable machine-parseable summary lines, and favors predictable outputs for automation.
Primary users: operators, sysadmins, and SREs working in constrained or air-gapped environments.

## Principles
- Bash-only runtime; avoid new dependencies.
- Output contracts are stable, parse-safe, and versioned where needed.
- Changes should be minimal and reversible; behavior changes require tests + docs.

## Success criteria
- One command provides a clear, actionable status report with sane defaults.
- Summary contract is consistent and validated across all monitors and CLI outputs.
- Works on RHEL 9 and common distros with explicit compatibility guidance.
- CI is reliable, deterministic, and low-flake.

## Priority legend
- P0: correctness, safety, and contract integrity
- P1: operator UX, docs, and compatibility
- P2: security, hardening, and performance
- P3: observability, integrations, and QA coverage
- P4: DX, release polish, and community

---

## P0 - Correctness and safety
- Validate monitor selection (`--only`/`--skip`/`LM_MONITORS`) against available scripts; fail fast on unknown names and show suggestions.
- Add `linux-maint lint-summary <file> [--json]` to validate summary files using existing contract lint; wire into tests.
- Ensure all `--json` outputs remain JSON-only even on parse errors (extend tests to cover invalid config lines + missing files).
- Add contract test to guarantee monitor ordering is stable for default runs (wrapper order and `--only` ordering behavior).

---

## P1 - Operator UX, docs, compatibility
- Add `linux-maint list-monitors` (name, optional/required config, and short description); document in QUICK_REFERENCE.
- Add `linux-maint run --plan` to show resolved host list + monitor list without executing; include `--json` output.
- Add a “Monitors Matrix” doc mapping each monitor to config inputs, outputs, and common actions.
- Add `docs/FAQ.md` covering common WARN/SKIP reasons and quick fixes; link from README.

---

## P2 - Security, hardening, performance
- Warn/CRIT on world-writable config/known_hosts files when strict modes are enabled (`LM_SSH_ALLOWLIST_STRICT`, pinned known_hosts).
- Validate `LM_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_PIN_FILE` presence/permissions; emit clear error + hint when invalid.
- Add optional `LM_REDACT_JSON_STRICT` to redact all string values (full scrub) for high-security environments.
- Add support bundle integrity metadata (size + sha256 per file) in `pack-logs` for tamper detection.

---

## P3 - Observability, integrations, QA coverage
- Emit Prometheus metrics for last run exit code and last run timestamp; add schema + tests.
- Add `linux-maint metrics --prom` to output textfile format on stdout for scraping.
- Add golden fixtures for `report --short` and `status --table` to lock formatting stability.
- Add integration test for `run --only/--skip` that executes a minimal monitor subset end-to-end.

---

## P4 - DX, release polish, community
- Add `tools/verify_release.sh` to validate tarball contents, checksum, and BUILD_INFO vs tag.
- Add `make ci-local` target that runs smoke + key contract tests with a clear summary.
- Add `CONTRIBUTORS.md` with contribution flow, testing expectations, and release checklist shortcuts.
