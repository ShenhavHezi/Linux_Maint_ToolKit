# Linux_Maint_ToolKit — Roadmap & Backlog (2026-02-24)

## Project brief
Linux_Maint_ToolKit is a lightweight, offline‑friendly Linux maintenance and health toolkit.
It runs locally or via SSH, emits machine‑parseable summary lines, and keeps outputs stable for automation.
Primary audiences: operators, sysadmins, and SREs working in constrained or air‑gapped environments.

## Principles
- Bash‑only runtime; no new runtime dependencies.
- Machine outputs are clean and parse‑safe (stdout contract preserved).
- Minimal, reversible changes; strong tests + docs for any behavior change.

## Priority legend
- P0: correctness / safety
- P1: operator UX / docs
- P2: security / hardening
- P3: observability / integrations
- P4: DX / release polish
