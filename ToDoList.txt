# Linux_Maint_ToolKit — Roadmap & Backlog (2026-02-24)

## Project brief
Linux_Maint_ToolKit is a lightweight, offline‑friendly Linux maintenance and health toolkit.
It runs locally or via SSH, emits machine‑parseable summary lines, and keeps outputs stable for automation.
Primary audiences: operators, sysadmins, and SREs working in constrained or air‑gapped environments.

## Principles
- Bash‑only runtime; no new runtime dependencies.
- Machine outputs are clean and parse‑safe (stdout contract preserved).
- Minimal, reversible changes; strong tests + docs for any behavior change.

## Priority legend
- P0: correctness / safety
- P1: operator UX / docs
- P2: security / hardening
- P3: observability / integrations
- P4: DX / release polish

---

## P0 — Correctness / safety (next)

No P0 items currently.

---

## P1 — Operator UX / docs (next)

1. SSH strict-mode quickstart (docs)
   Outcome: add a short operator flow for strict SSH (seed known_hosts + set `LM_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_MODE=strict`) in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.
   Acceptance: steps included and linked from docs index.

2. History usage examples
   Outcome: add a brief “when to use history” section (text vs `--table` vs `--json`) in `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`.
   Acceptance: examples included, no duplicate content in README.

---

## P2 — Security / hardening (soon)

1. known_hosts seeding tests
   Outcome: add tests for `tools/seed_known_hosts.sh` (user@host, host:port, IPv6 bracket form).
   Acceptance: tests run in smoke/CI; no network calls required.

2. SSH allowlist defaults (config template)
   Outcome: add commented `LM_SSH_ALLOWLIST` and `LM_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_MODE=strict` examples in `etc/linux_maint/linux-maint.conf.example`.
   Acceptance: examples documented and do not change defaults unless uncommented.

---

## P3 — Observability / integrations (later)

1. History JSON contract version
   Outcome: include `history_json_contract_version` in `linux-maint history --json` output.
   Acceptance: schema/test updated; contract documented in `docs/reference.md`.

2. Run index schema versioning
   Outcome: add `run_index_version` to JSONL entries for future compatibility.
   Acceptance: writer updated; schema/test updated; example entry documented.

---

## P4 — DX / release polish (later)

1. Local docs-check target
   Outcome: add `make docs-check` and include it in `tools/dev_check.sh`.
   Acceptance: local dev check runs docs link validation.

2. Release notes index automation
   Outcome: extend `tools/release_prep.sh` to update docs index pointers to the latest release notes.
   Acceptance: `docs/README.md` and `docs/INDEX.md` updated automatically.
