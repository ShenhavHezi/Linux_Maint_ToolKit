# Linux_Maint_ToolKit - Roadmap and Backlog (2026-02-24)

## Project brief
Linux_Maint_ToolKit is a lightweight, offline-friendly Linux maintenance and health toolkit.
It runs locally or via SSH, emits machine-parseable summary lines, and keeps outputs stable for automation.
Primary audiences: operators, sysadmins, and SREs working in constrained or air-gapped environments.

## Principles
- Bash-only runtime, no new runtime dependencies.
- Machine outputs are clean and parse-safe, stdout contract preserved.
- Minimal, reversible changes, tests and docs required for behavior changes.

## Success criteria
- One command gets a useful status report with sane defaults.
- Summary contract is stable and validated across all monitors and CLI outputs.
- Works on RHEL 9 and common distros with clear compatibility guidance.
- CI is reliable with low flake and deterministic tests.

## Priority legend
- P0: correctness and safety
- P1: operator UX, docs, compatibility
- P2: security, hardening, performance
- P3: observability, integrations, QA
- P4: DX, release polish, community
